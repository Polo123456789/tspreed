.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtspreed\fR is a terminal RSVP speed reader with Spritz-like functionality written in POSIX-compliant shell. It reads plain text from stdin and presents it one word at time.

If tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished, the progress of the presentation is passed to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-w\fR, \fB--wpm\fR \fIwpm\fR
Present words at the given WPM (words per minute). Required to be set. Minimum value of \fI1\fR, maximum value of \fI60000\fR.
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--num-start\fR \fInum\fR
Start presenting from the given \fIn\fRth word. Minimum value of \fI1\fR.
.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fB--separators\fR \fIchars\fR
Use the given characters to separate words in addition to the characters set in \fB$IFS\fR. Backslash escapes are interpreted.
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--length-vary\fR
Vary the speed words are presented at based on their length.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet-exit\fR
Do not output the presentation progress if tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--hide-cursor\fR
Hide the cursor during the presentation.
.TP
\fB-i\fR, \fB--progress-info\fR
Display progress information during the presentation.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--focus\fR
Highlight the focus letter (also known as the pivot or optimal recognition point) of the word being presented.
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--focus-pointer\fR \fIstyle\fR
Display pointers in a given style pointing towards the focus letter. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Styles: \fInone\fR, \fIline\fR, \fIpoint\fR.
.TP
\fB-b\fR, \fB--focus-bold\fR
Display the focus letter in bold. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--focus-color\fR \fIcolor\fR
Display the focus letter in the given color. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Color values are \fIANSI X3.64\fR 8-bit color values, ranging from \fI0\fR to \fI255\fR.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print \fBtspreed\fR version and exit.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success - presentation completed.
.TP
.B 1
Failure due to incorrect options/configuration.
.TP
.B 2
Failure due to system not supporting at least one of the required non-POSIX features or commands.
.TP
.B 3
Failure due to terminal (emulator) not supporting required capabilities.
.TP
.B 8
Presentation terminated before completion - no failure.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B IFS
Default characters used for word splitting.
.TP
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME
The local configuration file is located within the directory defined. Uses \f(BI$HOME\fI/.config\fR if not defined in compliance with the \fIXDG Base Directory Specification\fR.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/tspreed/tspreed.rc
Global configuration file.
.TP
.I \f(BI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/tspreed/tspreed.rc
Local configuration file.

.SH EXAMPLES
.P
$ \fBtspreed < textfile\fR
.P
$ \fBtspreed --wpm 300 --hide-cursor < textfile\fR
.P
$ \fBpdftotext document.pdf - | tspreed -w 300 -n 120 -s '\\r\\f' -lqihfb -p line -c 1\fR

.SH PORTABILITY
\fBtspreed\fR 'officially' supports GNU-based, BSD-based, and BusyBox-based systems only due to POSIX-compliance issues described below. This does not mean the script is guaranteed to not work on other Unix-like systems or issues specific to those systems will not be addressed, merely it is unknown how well supported the script is on other Unix-like systems.

\fBtspreed\fR attempts to comply with \fIPOSIX.1-2001\fR through to \fIPOSIX.1-2008\fR in order to maintain portability across Unix-like systems. However, \fBthe script must utilize at least one of the below non-compliant features or commands\fR and will exit with an error if none are supported:

.TP
\fBdate\fR(1)
Can return nanoseconds via the '%N' format.
.TP
\fBsleep\fR(1)
Supports the use of fractional values for the time operand to represent units of time less than 1 second, e.g. 0.05.
.TP
\fBsleep\fR(1)
Supports the use of E notation for the time operand to represent units of time less than 1 second, e.g. 5e-2.
.TP
\fBusleep\fR(1)

.P
The script utilizes terminal capabilities via \fBtput\fR(1), but will fall back to the following where possible if those capabilities fail:

.TP
\fIANSI X3.64\fR escape codes
For terminal styling and cursor movement
.TP
\fB$COLUMNS\fR, \fB$LINES\fR
For determining terminal size. Will fall back to 80 columns and/or 24 lines if one or both of the environmental variables are not set.
