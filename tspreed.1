.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtspreed\fR is a terminal RSVP speed reader with Spritz-like functionality written in POSIX shell. It reads plain text from stdin and presents it one word at time.

If tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished, the progress of the presentation is passed to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -w \fIwpm\fR
Speed words are presented at in words per minute. Required to be set. Minimum value of \fI1\fR, maximum value of \fI60000\fR.
.TP
.B -n \fInum\fR 
Start presenting from the nth word. Minimum value of \fI1\fR.
.TP
.B -l
Vary the speed words are presented at based on their length.
.TP
.B -q
Do not pass presentation progress to stdout if tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished.
.TP
.B -h
Hide the cursor during the presentation.
.TP
.B -i
Display progress information during the presentation.
.TP
.B -f
Highlight the focus letter (also known as the pivot or optimal recognition point) of the word being presented.
.TP
.B -p \fIstyle\fR
Display pointers in a given style pointing towards the focus letter. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Styles: \fInone\fR, \fIline\fR, \fIpoint\fR.
.TP
.B -b
Display the focus letter in bold. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled.
.TP
.B -c \fIcolor\fR
Display the focus letter in a given color. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Values are ANSI X3.64 8-bit color values, ranging from \fI0\fR to \fI255\fR.
.TP
.B -v
Print tspreed version and exit.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The values provided in the command options take precidence over the values of the user-specific config file, which takes precidence over the values of the system-wide config file.

Failure due to terminal/terminal emulator not supporting required capabilities.
.TP
.B 8
Presentation terminated before completion - no failure.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME
User-specific configuration is located within the directory defined. If \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is empty or not set, then \f(BI$HOME\fI/.config\fR is used in its place. This is in accordance with the XDG Base Directory Specification as defined by freedesktop.org.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/tspreed/tspreed.rc
Global configuration file.
.TP
.I \f(BI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/tspreed/tspreed.rc
Local configuration file.

.SH EXAMPLES
.P
$ \fBtspreed < textfile\fR
.P
$ \fBpdftotext document.pdf - | tspreed -w 300 -n 120 -lifb -p line -c 1\fR

.SH PORTABILITY 
\fBtspreed\fR 'officially' supports GNU-based systems and BSD-based systems (i.e. GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD). This does not mean the script will not work on any other Unix-like system or portability is not treated as a priority, however this does mean compatibility is not guarenteed on unsupported systems.

.B POSIX

\fBtspreed\fR attempts to adhere to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (a.k.a. SUSv3 or POSIX.1-2001) in order to be portable across Unix-like systems. However, non-compliant functionalities have been utilized to either overcome limitations of the standard or improve performance where possible. The script will determine at runtime which non-compliant functionalities the system supports and either exit with an error or adjust its behavior accordingly.

The only functionality which does not adhere to POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3 which the script must utilize is the '%N' format in \fBdate\fR(1). The script will exit with an error if this functionality is not supported by the system.

.B TERMINAL CAPABILITIES

\fBtspreed\fR utilizes terminal capabilities via \fBtput\fR(1) which no standard can guarantee the support of. Desipite this, the capabilities utilized are well-supported by terminal emulators and should only present issues for those using older (physical) terminals, obscure terminals/terminal emulators, or otherwise very limited terminals/terminal emulators. Listed below are the terminal capabilities utilized by the script.
