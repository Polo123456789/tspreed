# tspreed

tspreed is a terminal RSVP speed reader with Spritz-like functionality written in POSIX shell. It reads plain text from `stdin` and presents it one word at time.

If tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished, the progress of the presentation is passed to `stdout`.

## Configuration

The values provided in the command options take precidence over the values of the user-specific config file `~/.config/tspreed/tspreed.rc` (if defined, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tspreed/tspreed.rc` is used instead), which takes precidence over the values of the system-wide config file `/etc/tspreed/tspreed.rc`.

The default values are stored in [`./default.rc`](./default.rc), which is used as the system-wide config file after installation.
