# tspreed

tspreed is a terminal RSVP speed reader with Spritz-like functionality written in POSIX shell. It reads plain text from `stdin` and presents it one word at time.

If tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished, the progress of the presentation is passed to `stdout`.

## Installation

### Packages

#### Install

Replace github.com with gitlab.com if using GitLab.
```

```

## Usage

To use, pipe plain text into tspreed.

```
$ tspreed < textfile
```
```	
$ pdftotext document.pdf - | tspreed -w 300 -n 120 -lifb -p line -c 1
```

## Configuration

The values provided in the command options take precidence over the values of the local config file `~/.config/tspreed/tspreed.rc` (if defined, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tspreed/tspreed.rc` is used instead), which takes precidence over the values of the global config file `/etc/tspreed/tspreed.rc`.

The default values are stored in [`./default.rc`](./default.rc), which is installed as the global config during installation.

| Option     | Configuration file   | Default value | Description |
| ---        | ---                  | ---           | ---         |
| -w `wpm`   | wpm=`wpm`            | 300           | Speed words are presented at in words per minute. Required to be set. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 60000 |
| -n `num`   | numstart=`num`       |               | Start presenting from the nth word. Minimum value of 1. |
| -l         | lengthvary=`bool`    |               | Vary the speed words are presented at based on their length. |
| -q         | quietexit=`bool`     |               | Do not pass presentation progress to stdout if tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished. |
| -h         | hidecursor=`bool`    | true          | Hide the cursor during the presentation. |
| -i         | proginfo=`bool`      |               | Display progress information during the presentation. |
| -f         | focus=`bool`         |               | Highlight the focus letter (also known as the pivot or optimal recognition point) of the word being presented. |
| -p `style` | focuspointer=`style` | line          | Display pointers in a given style pointing towards the focus letter. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Styles: `none`, `line`, `point`. |
| -b         | focusbold=`bool`     | true          | Display the focus letter in bold. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. |
| -c `color` | focuscolor=`color`   | 1             | Display the focus letter in a given color. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Values are [ANSI X3.64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) 8-bit color values, ranging from 0 to 255. |
| -v         |                      |               | Print tspreed version and exit. |

## Portability

tspreed 'officially' supports GNU-based systems and BSD-based systems only (i.e. GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD). This does not mean the script will not work on other Unix-like systems or portability is not treated as a priority, however this does mean compatibility is not guaranteed on unsupported systems.

### POSIX

tspreed attempts to adhere to [IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (a.k.a. SUSv3 or POSIX.1-2001)](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/) in order to be portable across Unix-like systems. However, non-compliant functionalities have been utilized to either overcome limitations of the standard or improve performance where possible. The script will determine at runtime which non-compliant functionalities the system supports and either exit with an error or adjust its behavior accordingly.

The only functionality which does not adhere to POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3 which the script must utilize is the '%N' format in `date(1)`. The script will exit with an error if this functionality is not supported by the system.

### Terminal capabilities

tspreed utilizes terminal capabilities via `tput(1)` which no standard can guarantee the support of. However, the vast majority of terminals that support [ANSI X3.64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) escape codes, which have been well-supported since the 1980s, usually map the escape codes to the capabilities utilized, except `rmcup` and `smcup`. This means the capabilities utilized should only present issues for those using older (physical) terminals, obscure terminals/terminal emulators, or otherwise very limited terminals/terminal emulators.

Listed below are the terminal capabilities utilized by the script.

* `lines`
* `cols`
* `sgr0` - Only utilized if focusbold is enabled or focuscolor is set.
* `bold` - Only utilized if focusbold is enabled.
* `el`
* `cup`
* `setaf` - Only utilized if focuscolor is set.
* `cnorm` - Only utilized if hidecursor is enabled.
* `civis` - Only utilized if hidecursor is enabled.
* `rmcup`
* `smcup`

## Todo

* Add fallback method for when `rmcup` and/or `smcup` terminal capabilities are not supported.
* Pause/resume and forward/back as suggested [here](https://github.com/n-ivkovic/tspreed/issues/3).

## Contributing

Please attempt to adhere to the following when creating a pull request:

* Ensure [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) returns no errors/warnings. This can be checked by either running `make test` with ShellCheck installed or by checking [./tspreed](./tspreed) and [./default.rc](./default.rc) via the online checker (note: SC2148 and SC2034 will be thrown when checking ./default.rc via the online checker, this is expected and ok). If the changes made create errors/warnings please provide a justification.
* Ensure all changes conform to [IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (a.k.a. SUSv3 or POSIX.1-2001)](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/) as much as possible.
* Ensure all indentation is done with a single tab per indent.
* Ensure the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model is (somewhat) adhered to. Ensure changes are branched from `develop` and the pull request merges back into `develop`. Note that before the PR is accepted the target branch may be changed to a new branch named either `feature/[branch-name]` or `fix/[branch-name]`.
